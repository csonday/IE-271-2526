##  1. <a name='SoftwareInstallationGuides'></a>Software Installation Guides

We will be needing the following software for class. Note that we are using **pgadmin** and **VS Code** as integrated-development environments (IDEs) so that we don't have to work with PostGreSQL and Python for better workflow (vs using the terminal) -- if you are already using your own choice of IDEs, you can stick with it. 
* PostgreSQL - Our database management software.
* pgadmin - So we can use PostgreSQL thru a GUI. Other popular app for Linux/Mac users is DBeaver. 
* Python - Our language for the web-app.
* VS Code - Interface where we could manage our Python code. There are other alternatives like PyCharm and VIM. 

Please take note of the application/software versions indicated below.
